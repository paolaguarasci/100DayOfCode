## Log

This is my first round with this challenge!

### R1D1

I start whit beta path on freeCodeCamp RWB. Just for review the basic!

###Â R1D2
I just found out about beta.freecodecamp.org there is no trace of my progress yesterday!
~~Obviously, it's in beta yet!~~
~~I continue with the review, anyway: _CSS and JS basic_.~~
I have switch to stable curriculum.
Continue my last run:
-4 challenge to claim the front end certificate.

### R1D3

**I'm stuck on minimax algorithm.** I need it for one of the last challenges on my
path, "Tic Tac Toe". I'm tried doing this in C++ first because my JS is little confusing at the moment.
In fact, i decided to review my JS knowledge.

### R1D4

## **Minimax** at 35% done. It's a long way -.-''''

_Stop for exam!_
